# II International Colloquium of Romance Philologies for Students


**Second year**

**Representations of the world in language and literature**

The Department of Romance Languages, Faculty of Arts, Palacký University is pleased to announce the second year of CIFRE Olomouc colloquium that will take place on April 11-13, 2019. This proposal aims to offer a space for advanced students of French, Hispanic, Italian and Portuguese studies to present their works in order to gain experience in participation in this type of event.

## Thematic axis

Since the parietal paintings in the Cave of Altamira, until Kazuo Ishiguro’s “Never let me go”, the human beings always aspired to represent the circumstances in which they live and the world that surrounds them.

The history of a man is the history of communication and the attempt to portray the *theatrum mundi*.

In 1917, in his article “Art as device”, Viktor Shklovsky already defined the artistic function as an attempt to break the automatism of human perception. In his approach, the art is described as a new presentation of that what we are used to perceive automatically in our everyday lives.

Thus, the amazement experienced when subjected to art would be contained in the nature of perception and not in the piece of art itself.

Linguistics, in its turn, explores human communication and the processes that are involved. Roman Jakobson, for example, identifies the metaphor and the metonymy –two theoretical concepts that originate in literature– as the two cornerstones which the language is based on.

Therefore, we can understand literature and linguistics as two inherently and inextricably linked disciplines which are complementary. They focus on different aspects of the same phenomenon: the representation. For this second edition of CIFRE we propose *Representations of the world in language and literature* as a central theme.
